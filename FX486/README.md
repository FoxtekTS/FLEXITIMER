# FLEXITIMER FX486 - Standard Version

## Introduction
The **FX486** is the standard version of the FLEXITIMER project. It features an extended control board with modular connectivity, providing robust functionality for larger projects. The FX486 includes an 8-digit 7-segment display, an integrated NO/NC relay, and extra I/O ports for sensor or module integration.

## Features
- **Extended Control Board**: Allows for modular connectivity with additional sensors and modules.
- **NO/NC Relay**: Controls external devices based on the timer configuration.
- **8-Digit 7-Segment Display**: Provides clear visual feedback for timers, stopwatches, and clock functions.
- **I/O Expansion**: Extra pins for external modules or sensors (e.g., I2C and analog ports).
- **Compatible with Arduino Nano**: Programmed using the Arduino IDE and compatible with RTC modules.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.ino` files in the **Arduino IDE**.
3. Select the **Arduino Nano** board and the appropriate COM port.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino Nano.

## Usage
- **Numeric Keypad**: Enter values, start/stop timers, and reset the system.
- **Display**: Shows the time in clock mode, time remaining in countdown, and elapsed time in stopwatch mode.
- **Relay**: Trigger external devices based on programmed timing.
- **I/O Expansion**: Connect external sensors or devices via the extra I/O ports.
