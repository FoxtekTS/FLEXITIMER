# FLEXITIMER MX486 - Miniaturized Version

## Introduction
The **MX486** is the miniaturized version of the FLEXITIMER project. Designed for projects with limited space, 
it retains the essential features of the standard version (FX486) while offering a more compact design. 
The MX486 includes an integrated NO/NC relay and a 7-segment display for real-time timing operations.

## Features
- **Compact Control Board**: Small-sized board with integrated components.
- **NO/NC Relay**: Controls external devices based on programmed timing.
- **7-Segment Display**: Displays current time, countdown, and stopwatch readings.
- **Compatible with Arduino Nano**: Programmed using the Arduino IDE and compatible with RTC modules.

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.ino` files in the **Arduino IDE**.
3. Select the **Arduino Nano** board and the appropriate COM port.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino Nano.

## Usage
- **Numeric Keypad**: Enter values, start/stop timers, and reset the system.
- **Display**: Shows the time in clock mode, time remaining in countdown, and elapsed time in stopwatch mode.
- **Relay**: Trigger external devices based on programmed timing.
